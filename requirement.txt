Gradebook Analyzer 

The Gradebook Analyzer is a Python-based tool designed to process student marks, compute key statistics, assign grades, and generate organized output. The program allows users to enter data manually or load it from a CSV file, making it flexible for both small and larger datasets.

Once the marks are collected, the system calculates the average, median, highest score, and lowest score. It then assigns letter grades using a clear grading scale and displays the results in a structured table. The program also creates a grade distribution summary and identifies how many students passed or failed using list comprehensions.

For convenience, users can save the generated results into a new CSV file. The program runs in a loop, giving the user the option to analyze multiple sets of data without restarting.

Overall, the Gradebook Analyzer offers a simple, practical way to evaluate student performance and generate useful grade reports efficiently.
